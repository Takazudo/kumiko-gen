# Patterns

kumiko-gen includes 9 traditional Japanese geometric patterns. Each slug generates a unique combination of 2-4 overlaid patterns.

## Available Patterns

| Pattern | Japanese | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| asanoha | 麻の葉 | Hemp leaf star pattern |
| mitsukude | 三つ組手 | Triple interlocking pattern |
| goma | 胡麻 | Sesame seed pattern |
| shippo | 七宝 | Seven treasures interlocking circles |
| yae-asanoha | 八重麻の葉 | Double hemp leaf pattern |
| kikko | 亀甲 | Tortoiseshell hexagonal pattern |
| sakura | 桜 | Cherry blossom pattern |
| bishamon | 毘沙門 | Bishamon tortoiseshell pattern |
| izutsu | 井筒 | Well frame pattern |

## Pattern Selection

Patterns are selected deterministically based on the input slug. The slug is hashed to produce a seed, which determines:

- Number of layers (2-4)
- Which patterns are used in each layer
- Grid divisions (triangulation density)
- Color assignment from the palette
