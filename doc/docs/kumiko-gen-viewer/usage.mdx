## Controls

### Slug / Seed

Enter any text string to generate a unique pattern. Different slugs produce different pattern combinations.

### Divisions

Choose the grid density: 6, 8, or 10. Higher numbers create denser, more intricate patterns.

### Zoom

Adjust the zoom level from 1.0 to 10.0. Higher values zoom into the center of the pattern.

### Color Scheme

Select from 30+ preset color schemes. Each scheme provides a background color and 7 line colors. Schemes are based on popular terminal/editor themes like Dracula, Nord, and Catppuccin.

Each generated pattern has 2-4 layers. For each layer you can adjust:
- **Foreground color**: The line color for that layer
- **Stroke width**: Line thickness (0.3 to 5.0)
